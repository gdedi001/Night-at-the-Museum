## Statement of Purpose
> "Night at the museum is a mobile VR experience for users who want to learn more about the future of VR in an interactive fashion"

## Requirements
Prior to starting this project, I was instructed to do research on a VR company/technology, or an industry that could be impacted by VR. After conducting my research, the goal was to create 
a mobile virtual reality experience with 'information booths' which include both visual and audio feedback for users. These booths are to showcase 
my findings - the goal here is to inform other people about the topic at hand in a fun and creative way through a series of (at least five) display points. 
Users should be able to travel back and forth between display areas inside the space. This is not a VR slideshow, it is a VR space which contains the 
information about my research. Some potential outputs of this project are creating a scene in a museum, science fair, or gallery-like space which showcases your findings.

## Results
The VR industry is a rapidly evolving landscape and as such, I wanted to focus on the bigger picture rather than a particular company/technology. The notion of having five display points 
sparked an idea which lead me to research how VR technologies could have an impact on the five known senses unique to the human experience: **_Sight, Hearing, Taste, Smell, Touch_**.
Each display point (exhibit) showcases a 3D model representing the sense and when clicked, invokes a video. These videos educate the user on a VR technology specific to the sense.

## Unity Version / GVRSDK
* Unity 5.6.0f3
* Google VR Unity SDK (v 1.4.0)

## Some interesting learning experiences
* Finding 3D models and assets outside the Unity Asset Store
* Exporting prefabs/assets from old projects
* Upgrading to new version GearVR SDK
* Submitting application to Google's Play Store (**_in progress_**)
* Tinkering with double-sided shaders

## Final Thoughts
This was the first time I had the opportunity to build an entire mobile VR application from scratch, and as such, hit many roadblocks. Completing this project in a timely mannor
was a testiment to my dedication and organizational skills. I can't wait to continue on and complete the specializations within the nanodegree.
